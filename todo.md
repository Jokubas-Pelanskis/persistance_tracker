- Implement a feature where a a calculation could only modify a single file or folder. This probably needs a different label (on top of 'input' and 'output'). Could be something like 'modify'. This will create circular loops, therefore when I trace proverance, this needs to be handeled separately not to run into infinite loops.
    (At the moment the only way of doing this is by creating explicit inputs and outputs and the flow has to be preserved, there is no way of modifying a file in place. This feature could be powerful.)
